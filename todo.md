# TO DO

> Same-level bullet points ordered by when I plan to do them, bold *must* be done by the time it changes to not be beta anymore, and sub-bullets *must* be completed before a higher bullet can be completed. (unless there is a question mark)

* Document as much of the undocumented code as feasible.
* Re-organize the entire library to work with Require.js (and Dojo too?)
 * Test on `ASM.js`?
 * Test on `Configure.js`?
 * Test on `Require.js`
 * Test on `Dojo`
* create modifiable elements (html-only)
* Place element in exact location (enter in numbers) (html-only)
* Place zoom location in exact location (enter in numbers) (html-only)
* Move element counter into update function?? may not be worth it
