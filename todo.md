# TO DO

> Same-level bullet points ordered by when I plan to do them, bold *must* be done by the time it changes to not be beta anymore, and sub-bullets *must* be completed before a higher bullet can be completed. (unless there is a question mark)

* Release 2.0.0
* create modifiable elements (html-only)?
* Place element in exact location (enter in numbers) (html-only)?
* Place zoom location in exact location (enter in numbers) (html-only)?
* Move element counter into update function?? may not be worth it
